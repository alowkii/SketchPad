This webpage has been solely focused to be created only using JavaScript. So as you'll see most of the code in this project is written is javascript.
JavaScript: 93%
HTML: 3%
CSS: 3%

Bare in mind the code absolutelty doesn't use the given features of JavaScript that could be used extensively.
For example:
Input tag with type field set to 'color' could have given a more absoulte value for the cursor color.
But extensively the code is there to provide a context of how a color can be extracted from a given set of color palette.

As a conclusion, it must be understood the webpage is extensively written for the purpose of demonstration of raw JavaScript.
